This repository is a scratch space for some experiments with UI frameworks. For commit access please contact @Hixie.

See [our contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

While some of the contributors to this repository are Google employees, this is not an officially supported Google product, or, 
indeed, a product of any kind. It's a dumping group so that we can share experiments with each other, comparing different UI 
toolkits or frameworks and approaches used in developing those UI frameworks. Lessons learnt from these experiments will hopefully 
help us make better toolkits!
